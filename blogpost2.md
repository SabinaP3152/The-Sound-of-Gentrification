A look at 311 noise complaints in three neighborhoods in Manhattan and the Bronx in 2011 shows a correlation between noise complaints and gentrification and suggests that when higher income people move into historically lower income neighborhoods the moment of greatest protestation occurs in the first phase of gentrification when new arrivals are undergoing culture shock. Details of calls retrieved from NYC OpenData show that 311 noise complaints in Hamilton Heights, which was starting to become gentrified around 2011, are much more numerous than those made in Central Harlem, which was firmly gentrified by then. Both neighborhoods generated much higher volumes of noise complaints than Mott Haven in the South Bronx, which in 2011 was not gentrified yet. I doubt that Mott Haven was quieter than Hamilton Heights and Central Harlem and wonder whether Central Harlem was quieter than Hamilton Heights because incomers had persistently complained about noise when they first got there. I hope not and hope instead that high to middle income migrants had gotten used to block parties and noisy barbecues by the time the data I accessed was produced.  
Comparing number and types of noise complaints in three New York City neighborhoods in 2011 may be useful for people who want to buy or rent affordable housing but wish to avoid places they might find culturally dissonant as well as for people who are looking for rich and lively communities where they think they will feel happy and comfortable.  
In my visualization I use a map to situate the three neighborhoods geographically, drawing their boundaries and pinpointing them with pie charts whose relative sizes represent the number of 311 noise complaints made in each. I did not want to use pie charts. I wanted to visualize noise complaints with colorful scatter plots in each of the three neighborhoods and tried hard to do this, but I’m not yet expert enough with the software so for now pie charts must do. If you hover over the pie charts you will see why complaints were made, the zip code they were made in, and the total number of complaints of that type in the given zip code. Below the map is a bar chart which visualizes the same data in a different way, showing the number of noise complaints on the vertical axis and the places where the noise was allegedly made on the horizontal axis.

In this data visualization I chose to include 311 complaints about noise emanating from residences, parks, streets or sidewalks and houses of worship because these types of noise complaints are mostly reactions to loud music played by neighborhood residents as well as expressions of aggravation at members of the community talking more loudly than the complainant likes. I included banging and pounding noise complaints because these often indicate apartment renovation or redecoration and am interested to see that in Central Harlem in 2011 there were more banging and pounding complaints but fewer loud music/party complaints than in Hamilton Heights. If noise complaints can be interpreted as partly indicative of noise levels in a neighborhood – and I’m convinced that they can’t because I don’t believe that Mott Haven was the quietest neighborhood of the three – one could assume that people living in Central Harlem in 2011 were doing more home building than hanging out. On the other hand, while noise complaints don’t tell us how much noise there was in Central Harlem, Hamilton Heights and Mott Haven in 2011, they do inform our understandings of these neighborhoods insofar as they tell us what kinds of noise bugged residents most.
In my visualization I excluded available noise complaint data for general noise, commercial noise, noise of helicopters, vehicle noise and a mysterious noise survey. I excluded these because since they are not necessarily complaints about noise made by neighborhood residents they can’t be read as recently arrived migrants protesting habitual cultural practices of indigenous inhabitants.
I wanted to show a timeline in the lower graph to see if more complaints were made in the summer when there are always more block parties and socializing in the street but didn’t find the exact day and time or even month each call was made in my data, so I couldn’t do that. I’m considering adding census data to my visualization to get a better idea of who lived in the neighborhoods I look at, what their incomes were and other demographics, and to try to figure out which kinds of neighborhood resident might have made all these 311 complaints.
